## ðŸŽ¯ Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Preparation (Week 11)

#### DNS and Domain Setup
```bash
# DNS configuration for velorialabs.com
# Primary A record
velorialabs.com.        300     IN  A       104.198.14.52

# CDN configuration
cdn.velorialabs.com.    300     IN  CNAME   d3k1p6w2q8xz4r.cloudfront.net.

# Subdomain setup
www.velorialabs.com.    300     IN  CNAME   velorialabs.com.
blog.velorialabs.com.   300     IN  CNAME   velorialabs.com.
```

#### CDN and Caching Strategy
```javascript
// Cloudflare/AWS CloudFront configuration
const cachingRules = {
  static_assets: {
    pattern: "*.{css,js,png,jpg,jpeg,gif,ico,svg,woff,woff2}",
    cache_ttl: "1 year",
    browser_ttl: "1 year"
  },
  html_pages: {
    pattern: "*.html",
    cache_ttl: "1 hour",
    browser_ttl: "1 hour"
  },
  api_responses: {
    pattern: "/api/*",
    cache_ttl: "5 minutes",
    browser_ttl: "0"
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Staging Deployment (Week 11-12)

#### Staging Environment Setup
```yaml
# staging.yml - Docker configuration
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=staging
      - API_URL=https://staging-api.velorialabs.com
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
    restart: unless-stopped

  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      - ./ssl:/etc/ssl
    depends_on:
      - web
```

#### Staging Testing Protocol
```javascript
// staging-tests.js
const stagingChecklist = {
  performance: {
    lighthouse_score: "> 90",
    load_time: "< 2.5s",
    core_web_vitals: "all green"
  },
  functionality: {
    navigation: "all links working",

  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (Week 12)

#### Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategy
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy.sh - Zero-downtime deployment script

echo "Starting Veloria Labs deployment..."

# Build optimized production bundle
npm run build

# Create backup of current deployment
aws s3 sync s3://velorialabs-production s3://velorialabs-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Deploy new version to S3
aws s3 sync ./dist s3://velorialabs-production --delete

# Invalidate CloudFront cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id E1234567890 --paths "/*"

# Health check
curl -f https://velorialabs.com/health || exit 1

echo "Deployment completed successfully!"
```

#### Blue-Green Deployment Setup
```yaml
# blue-green-deployment.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: veloria-labs-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: veloria-labs
    version: blue  # Switch to 'green' during deployment
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 3000

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: veloria-labs-blue
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: veloria-labs
      version: blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: veloria-labs
        version: blue
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web
        image: velorialabs/website:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Alerts

### Real-Time Monitoring Setup
```javascript
// monitoring.js - Production monitoring
const monitoring = {
  uptime: {
    service: "Pingdom",
    check_interval: "1 minute",
    locations: ["US East", "US West", "Europe"],
    alert_threshold: "down for 2 minutes"
  },
  
  performance: {
    service: "SpeedCurve",
    metrics: ["LCP", "FID", "CLS"],
    alert_threshold: "10% degradation"
  },
  
  errors: {
    service: "Sentry",
    error_tracking: "JavaScript errors",
    alert_threshold: "error rate > 1%"
  },
  
  analytics: {
    service: "Google Analytics 4",
    real_time: "visitor tracking",
    conversions: "contact form submissions"
  }
}
```

### Alert Configuration
```yaml
# alerts.yml - Monitoring alerts
alerts:
  - name: "Website Down"
    condition: "uptime < 99%"
    notification: ["email", "slack", "sms"]
    escalation: "15 minutes"
  
  - name: "Performance Degradation"
    condition: "LCP > 3 seconds"
    notification: ["email", "slack"]
    escalation: "30 minutes"
  
  - name: "High Error Rate"
    condition: "error_rate > 5%"
    notification: ["email", "slack"]
    escalation: "immediate"
```

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Strategy

### Automated Rollback Triggers
```javascript
// rollback.js - Automatic rollback conditions
const rollbackTriggers = {
  performance_degradation: {
    condition: "lighthouse_score < 80",
    action: "automatic_rollback",
    timeout: "5 minutes"
  },
  
  error_spike: {
    condition: "error_rate > 10%",
    action: "automatic_rollback", 
    timeout: "2 minutes"
  },
  
  uptime_failure: {
    condition: "uptime < 95%",
    action: "automatic_rollback",
    timeout: "3 minutes"
  }
}
```

### Manual Rollback Procedure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rollback.sh - Emergency rollback script

echo "Initiating emergency rollback..."

# Get latest backup
BACKUP=$(aws s3 ls s3://velorialabs-backup/ | sort | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $4}')

# Restore from backup
aws s3 sync s3://velorialabs-backup/$BACKUP s3://velorialabs-production --delete

# Invalidate cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id E1234567890 --paths "/*"

# Verify rollback
curl -f https://velorialabs.com/health

echo "Rollback completed. System restored to previous version."
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Success Metrics Tracking
```javascript
// success-metrics.js
const launchMetrics = {
  technical_metrics: {
    lighthouse_score: {
      target: "> 90",
      current: null,
      status: "monitoring"
    },
    page_load_time: {
      target: "< 2.5s",
      current: null,
      status: "monitoring"
    },
    uptime: {
      target: "> 99.9%",
      current: null,
      status: "monitoring"
    }
  },
  
  business_metrics: {
    conversion_rate: {
      baseline: "2%",
      target: "4%",
      current: null,
      status: "monitoring"
    },
    time_on_site: {
      baseline: "1:30",
      target: "2:30", 
      current: null,
      status: "monitoring"
    },
    technical_leads: {
