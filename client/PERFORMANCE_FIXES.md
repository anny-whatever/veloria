# Performance Optimizations Implemented

This document outlines the performance improvements made to address high-priority issues.

## 1. URL Canonicalization

URL canonicalization ensures search engines recognize various URL formats as a single entity, improving SEO performance.

### Implementation:

- Added URL canonicalization in server.js using `setCanonicalHeaders` middleware
- Created redirection logic for:
  - www vs non-www domains
  - HTTP to HTTPS redirects
  - Removing trailing slashes
- Added canonical link headers in HTTP responses
- Implemented service worker with URL normalization for client-side navigation

### How to test:

```bash
# Test different URL variations - all should redirect to preferred domain
curl -I http://www.veloria.in/services/
curl -I http://veloria.in/services/
curl -I https://www.veloria.in/services/
curl -I https://veloria.in/services
```

## 2. Custom 404 Error Page

A custom 404 page helps retain users when they encounter missing pages.

### Implementation:

- Created `NotFound.jsx` component with:
  - Clear error messaging
  - Navigation links to popular pages
  - Contact options
  - SEO meta headers
- Added catch-all route in React Router to handle 404s
- Added server-side 404 handling in Express for non-existing routes

### How to test:

Access any non-existent route (e.g., /this-page-does-not-exist) to see the custom 404 page.

## 3. Render-Blocking Resources

Removing render-blocking resources speeds up page load and improves Core Web Vitals metrics.

### Implementation:

- Added preload hints for critical resources using `generatePreloadHints` function
- Implemented resource prioritization with `fetchpriority` attributes
- Enhanced caching strategy with appropriate `Cache-Control` headers
- Added code splitting for vendor bundles
- Improved Service Worker caching for static assets

### How to test:

```bash
# Run Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse https://veloria.in --view
```

## 4. Modern Image Formats

Modern image formats like WebP and AVIF significantly reduce file sizes while maintaining quality.

### Implementation:

- Added `vite-imagetools` to generate multiple image formats
- Configured automatic WebP and AVIF generation
- Added `<picture>` element support for browser format selection
- Implemented responsive images with appropriate sizing
- Added appropriate caching for image assets

### How to test:

1. Check Network tab in DevTools to confirm multiple image formats
2. Verify proper format delivery based on browser support
3. Compare image file sizes in Network tab

## Installation Instructions
